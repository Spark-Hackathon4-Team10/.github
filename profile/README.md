## AI-Based Resume Ranking for Recruitment

### Context: 
Recruiters often receive hundreds of resumes for a single job opening. Manually reviewing and comparing each resume against the job description is time-consuming and can lead to inconsistent or biased decisions. An AI-based tool can help streamline this process by automatically evaluating and ranking resumes based on how well they match the job requirements.

### Objective: 
Help HR teams save time and improve candidate screening by building a tool that ranks uploaded resumes according to how closely they align with a given job description.

### Task: 
Design and develop an AI-based application where HR personnel can:
Upload multiple resumes in PDF format
Paste or enter a job description
Automatically receive a ranked list of candidates based on fit

Your system should include:

### Input:
A job description (text input)
A set of resumes (PDF files)

### Output:
Ranked list of resumes based on relevance to the job description
Breakdown of matching factors (e.g., experience, skills, education, languages)

### Company: Harri
